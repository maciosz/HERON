Find peaks using HMM from hmmlearn.

Preliminary test version of beta version.

Current usage:

./peakcaller.py -i sample1.bedgraph sample2.bedgraph

Current output:
prints list of peaks

Warning.
Assumes that bedgraphs have fixed resolution
 and starts with coordinate 0
 (bedgraphs are indeed 0-relative,
 but technically they might start from something else).
