Find peaks using HMM from hmmlearn.

Preliminary test version of beta version.

Current usage:

./peakcaller.py -i sample1.bedgraph sample2.bedgraph ...

Current output:
 prints list of peaks: start \t end (it actually doesn't make sense)
 generates file 'states' with, well, states
 can be pasted with windows.bed, awked and used as bed with states

Warning.
Assumes that bedgraphs have fixed resolution,
 starts with coordinate 0
 (bedgraphs are indeed 0-relative,
 but technically they might start from something else)
 and have one chromosome.
